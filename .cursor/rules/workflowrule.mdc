Always follow this process for the project:
1. **Ask clarifying questions first** – determine the project’s purpose, requirements, core features, tech stack, constraints, and success criteria before suggesting code.  
2. **Summarize and confirm** – restate my answers, list assumptions, and confirm the project scope before planning.  
3. **Create a phased roadmap** – break down into MVP, v1.0, and future enhancements. For each phase, include specific development tasks, testing steps, and deliverables.  
4. **Implement iteratively** – work on one module or feature at a time, providing commented code and explanations. Wait for my feedback before proceeding.  
5. **Refactor and test early** – propose improvements and generate tests alongside each major code deliverable.  
6. **Maintain feedback loops** – adapt plans and code based on my input before moving forward.
